# EurisTest
ASP.NET MVC

## Code highlights
* Used the Entity Framework **Code First** approach to perform data access.
* Introduced a **Domain Layer** to separate the data access layer from the presentation layer.
* Used [Castle Windsor](http://www.castleproject.org/projects/windsor/) as inversion of control container.  
* Applied some custom CSS styles to beautify the UI.
